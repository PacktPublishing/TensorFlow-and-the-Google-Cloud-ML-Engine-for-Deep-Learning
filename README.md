# TensorFlow and the Google Cloud ML Engine for Deep Learning [Video]
This is the code repository for TensorFlow and the Google Cloud ML Engine for Deep Learning [Video](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/tensorflow-and-google-cloud-ml-engine-deep-learning-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
TensorFlow is quickly becoming the technology of choice for deep learning, because of how easy TF makes it to build powerful and sophisticated neural networks. The Google Cloud Platform is a great place to run TF models at scale, and perform distributed training and prediction. This is a comprehensive, from-the-basics course on TensorFlow and building neural networks. It assumes no prior knowledge of Tensorflow, all you need to know is basic Python programming.
